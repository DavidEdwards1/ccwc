# CCWC

A `wc` clone built in Rust. The [first challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc)
from John Crickett's [Weekly Coding Challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) newsletter. This project
is intended soley for educational purposes and should not be used, prefer [`wc`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/wc-invocation.html#wc-invocation).

## How to Use

Starting from this source code, you can build `ccwc` with `cargo build -r`. This
creates an exectuable in `target/release` called `ccwc`. You can add this directory
to your `PATH` (or move the exectuable to somewhere on your `PATH`) and then
run `ccwc --help` for more information.
